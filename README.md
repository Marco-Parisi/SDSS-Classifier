# SDSS-Classifier (work in progress)
The SDSS Classifier is a project for analyzing and classifying data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which observes the night sky with photometric and spectroscopic measurements of stars, galaxies, and quasars. Developed in Jupyter Notebook, it uses pandas and scikit-learn for initial data analysis and PyTorch for building a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) model. SDSS data are public accessible and can be download from https://www.sciserver.org/.
